This app is a stock Rails 2.3.14 app, with Bundler installed
according to: http://gembundler.com/rails23.html

It's Gemfile contain a minimal set of gems (but also RSpec / Cucumber)
for the tests.

In addition, there is one plugin "rails_history" - inherited from a really
old, Rails 1.2.3 project.

Problem Description
-------------------

If Rspec is specified in the Gemfile (as it is when checked in), the app
doesn't run and dies because the "history" keyword (which is provided by the
plugin) isn't loaded.

Disabling RSpec (by removing the :development group), makes the app start just
fine
